# SQHELP

**sqhelp** is a simple app designed to help users practice SQL queries. sqhelp provides exercises that let you create, execute, and validate SQL queries.

## How it Works

### Query Creation

sqhelp allows you to create SQL queries using a simple text-based interface. You input your query in plain text, and sqhelp provides real-time feedback on the syntax and potential errors.

### Query Execution

Once you've crafted your SQL query, you can execute it against a sample database provided by sqhelp. You'll instantly see the results of your query, allowing you to verify its accuracy and fine-tune it as needed.

### Query Validation

sqhelp provides feedback on your query's correctness, highlighting any syntax errors or potential issues. It helps you understand why a particular query might not be working as expected.
